## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure Process

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** security concerns to: `security@pipeline-automation-hub.dev` (if available) or create a private issue
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### 📋 What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Location**: File paths, line numbers, affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Impact**: How this could be exploited and potential damage
- **Environment**: Versions, operating system, browser (if applicable)
- **Proof of Concept**: Code snippet or screenshots (if safe to share)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Document Processing Security
- **File Validation**: All uploaded files are validated before processing
- **Sanitization**: Content is sanitized during processing

- **Type Checking**: Only supported file types are processed

### Web Application Security
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (when implemented)
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in CSRF protection
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Headers**: Security headers implemented
- **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS in production

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have rate limiting
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs validated
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages (no sensitive data leak)
- **Authentication**: API endpoints require proper authentication
- **Logging**: Security events are logged

### Infrastructure Security
- **Dependencies**: Regular dependency updates
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables for sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: Security monitoring in place
- **Backups**: Regular backups with encryption

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- **Code Review**: All code goes through security-focused reviews
- **Dependencies**: Only trusted dependencies are added
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- **Testing**: Security testing for new features
- **Documentation**: Security implications documented

### For Users
- **Updates**: Keep the application updated to latest version
- **Environment**: Use secure environment variables

- **Webhook Security**: Secure webhook endpoints (if implemented)

### Database Security (if using database features)
- **Connection**: Use encrypted database connections
- **Access**: Database access restricted to application
- **Backup**: Secure database backups
- **Migration**: Review database migrations for security implications

## 🛠️ Security Tools and Automation

### Automated Security Checks
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **License Compliance**: License compatibility checking
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevent secrets from being committed

### CI/CD Security
- **Build Security**: Secure build environment
- **Test Security**: Security tests in CI pipeline
