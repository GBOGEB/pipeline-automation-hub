# Workflow Files Note

Due to GitHub App permissions, the following workflow files need to be manually added:

- `.github/workflows/rtm-update.yml` - RTM update automation
- `.github/workflows/validation.yml` - RTM validation workflow

These files are available in the RTM integration package and should be added by a repository administrator with workflow permissions.

The workflow files provide:
1. Automated RTM generation and updates
2. Requirement validation on pull requests
3. Integration with KEB Digital Twin and HEPAK projects
4. Continuous RTM monitoring and reporting

Please contact the RTM integration team for the complete workflow files.
