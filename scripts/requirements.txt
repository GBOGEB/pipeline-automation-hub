## Installation Notes
# 
# Install all dependencies:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Install only core dependencies:
# pip install pytest black flake8 isort python-dateutil
#
# For development:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# pip install -e .  # if setup.py exists
#
# For production:
# pip install --no-dev -r requirements.txt

## Version Management
# These versions are tested and known to work together.
# Newer versions may work but should be tested thoroughly.
# Pin versions in production environments.

## Security Notes
# Regularly update dependencies to get security patches:
# pip list --outdated
# pip install --upgrade package_name
# 
# Use safety to check for known vulnerabilities:
# safety check
# safety check -r requirements.txt

## Performance Notes
# Some packages have C extensions for better performance:
# - Install with --no-cache-dir for consistent builds
# - Use wheels when available for faster installation
# - Consider using pip-tools for dependency resolution

## Compatibility
# Python 3.8+ required for most packages
# Python 3.11+ recommended for best performance
# Some optional packages may have additional system requirements
